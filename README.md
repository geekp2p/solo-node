# Solo Node (Mainnet + Testnet) for Avalon Nano 3S

## Quickstart

1. **Fetch the CKPool sources.** The CKPool containers compile the daemon at
   build time, so populate `ckpool/src/` before starting Docker. From the repo
   root run:

   ```bash
   ./ckpool/fetch-source.sh [--force] [--url <git-url>] [--branch <branch>]
   ```

   The script defaults to cloning
   `https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool-solo.git` (branch `solobtc`) but you
   can also override these values via the CLI flags above or the environment
   variables `CKPOOL_REPO_URL`, `CKPOOL_REPO_BRANCH`, and
   `CKPOOL_FORCE_FETCH=1`. The `--force` flag is handy when you want to replace
   an existing checkout with a fresh copy.

   > On Windows run the script from Git Bash (bundled with Git for Windows) so
   > the POSIX shell commands inside the script are available. If your machine
   > cannot reach Bitbucket, manually clone the repo and copy its contents into
   > `ckpool/src/`, ensuring the `autogen.sh` file exists before continuing.

2. **Optional: customize credentials and payout addresses.** If you need to
   override the defaults, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the values you
   would like to change. The repository keeps `.env` in `.gitignore` so your
   host-specific paths and secrets stay local. If you skip this step the stack
   simply uses the defaults baked into `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Bring up the stack.**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   If you refresh the CKPool sources (for example by re-running
   `./ckpool/fetch-source.sh`), rebuild the containers so the new code is used:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build --force-recreate
   ```


4. **Tail the logs to verify sync and pool startup.**

   ```bash
   docker logs -f bitcoind-main
   docker logs -f bitcoind-testnet
   docker logs -f ckpool-solo-main
   docker logs -f ckpool-solo-testnet
   ```

The CKPool builder image now reads the upstream sources from
`ckpool/src/` inside this repository. Fetching them ahead of time keeps
`docker compose up` from needing external Bitbucket access during the
image build, which helps on networks where Docker cannot reach
bitbucket.org directly.

- Mainnet Stratum (BFGMiner proxy, upstream CKPool): `stratum+tcp://<HOST_IP>:3333`
- Mainnet Stratum (CKPool direct):                 `stratum+tcp://<HOST_IP>:3334`
- Testnet Stratum (BFGMiner proxy, upstream CKPool): `stratum+tcp://<HOST_IP>:13333`
- Testnet Stratum (CKPool direct):                   `stratum+tcp://<HOST_IP>:13334`

BFGMiner proxies now connect to the CKPool stratum instead of hitting
`bitcoind`'s RPC interface directly. This avoids the HTTP/JSON decode errors
seen when miners point at the proxy ports during initial startup. If you want
the proxies to forward to an external CKPool endpoint instead of the bundled
containers, set `CKPOOL_MAIN_HOST`/`CKPOOL_MAIN_PORT` or
`CKPOOL_TESTNET_HOST`/`CKPOOL_TESTNET_PORT` in `.env`.

Default RPC credentials and payout addresses are baked into the
`docker-compose.yml` so the stack works out of the box. If you would like to
override them, create a `.env` file alongside `docker-compose.yml` with any of
the following variables:

```
RPC_USER=customrpcuser
RPC_PASSWORD=custommainpass
RPC_USER_TESTNET=customtestrpc
RPC_PASSWORD_TESTNET=customtestpass
PAYOUT_ADDRESS=bc1...
PAYOUT_ADDRESS_TESTNET=tb1...
# Point the stack at an external bitcoind host if needed
BITCOIN_MAIN_RPC_HOST=10.1.1.243
BITCOIN_MAIN_RPC_PORT=8332
BITCOIN_TESTNET_RPC_HOST=10.1.1.243
BITCOIN_TESTNET_RPC_PORT=18332
# Point the BFGMiner proxies at a different CKPool stratum endpoint if needed
CKPOOL_MAIN_HOST=ckpool.example.com
CKPOOL_MAIN_PORT=3333
CKPOOL_TESTNET_HOST=ckpool-testnet.example.com
CKPOOL_TESTNET_PORT=3333
```

Any values omitted from `.env` fall back to the defaults shown in this README.
If the file does not exist at all Docker Compose still uses those defaults, so
you only need to create `.env` when you actually want to override something.

The CKPool containers now generate their `ckpool.conf` at startup using these
environment variables, so pointing them at another node or payout address no
longer requires editing JSON files inside the repo.

The Bitcoin Core containers now keep their block data inside Docker named
volumes (`solo-node_bitcoin-main-data` and `solo-node_bitcoin-testnet-data`).
This keeps configuration files that live in `bitcoin-main/`,
`bitcoin-testnet/`, and `ckpool/` mounted read-only inside the containers so
they are always available. If you prefer to store the blockchain on a different
drive you can override those named volumes with a host path.

### Storing blockchain data on a different drive (Windows)

By default Docker Desktop for Windows mounts repositories from the `C:` drive.
If you would like to store the synced Bitcoin data on another drive (for
example `G:` because the `C:` drive does not have enough free space), add the
following lines to your `.env` file:

```
BITCOIN_MAIN_DATA_PATH=G:/solo/bitcoin-main-data
BITCOIN_TESTNET_DATA_PATH=G:/solo/bitcoin-testnet-data
```

Create the `G:\solo\bitcoin-main-data` and `G:\solo\bitcoin-testnet-data`
directories before starting Docker so the bind mounts can be created. When
these environment variables are set Docker Compose uses the specified host
paths while still mounting the configuration directories from the repository
read-only. Because `bitcoin.conf` remains mounted from `./bitcoin-main` and
`./bitcoin-testnet` you do **not** need to copy it into the data folders.

### Connecting miners

Use a Stratum URL (`stratum+tcp://`) that matches the network and pool flavor
you intend to mine against. Examples for `cpuminer-gw64-corei7`:

```bash
# Mainnet via the CKPool stratum
cpuminer-gw64-corei7 -a sha256d -o stratum+tcp://<HOST_IP>:3334 -u <your_mainnet_address> -p x

# Testnet via the CKPool stratum
cpuminer-gw64-corei7 -a sha256d -o stratum+tcp://<HOST_IP>:13334 -u mzpJE5cWrFzGuVr1SidxEsRBDgFgPC5VmD -p x
```

Replacing `stratum+tcp://` with `http://` will cause the miner to time out, so
ensure the scheme and port match one of the Stratum endpoints listed above.


### Troubleshooting

#### `open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.`

This error from `docker compose` indicates that Docker Desktop is not
running or its backend service (the Windows named pipe
`dockerDesktopLinuxEngine`) is unavailable. Start Docker Desktop and wait for
it to report that the Docker engine is running before rerunning `docker
compose up`. If the problem persists, restart Docker Desktop or reboot the
host to re-establish the named pipe connection.

#### `Stratum connect failed ... Could not resolve host: ckpool-testnet.example.com`

The BFGMiner proxies default to the internal CKPool containers
(`ckpool-solo-main` and `ckpool-solo-testnet`). If you set
`CKPOOL_MAIN_HOST`/`CKPOOL_TESTNET_HOST` in `.env`, ensure those hostnames
resolve from inside the Docker network. Leaving these variables commented in
`.env` will use the built-in container names that work out of the box.
